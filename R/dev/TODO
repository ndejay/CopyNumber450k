IMPORTANT:
We might have a problem with "summary".  Consider the following scenario:

mcds <- MethylCNVDataSetFromRGChannelSet(RGSet)
mcds <- dropVariantProbes(mcds)
mcds.func <- normalize(mcds, "functional")

If we drop features in the 2nd step, "summary" (result of extractFromRGChannel450k)
will have been calculated on every single feature.  There will be an inconsistency
between the contents of "summary" and the data sent passed on to the normalization
method.

The only solution is to RGChannelSet in MethylCNVDataSet (I'm positive there's a
place in hell for doing something this dirty) or directly extending RGChannelSet
as you have done previously.  However, we need RGChannelSet as well as MethylSet so
this won't quite cut it, unless MethylSet extends RGChannelSet as opposed to containing
only the "meth" and "unmeth".  But MethylSet does not extend RGChannelSet.  This
needs need to be addressed.

* Not an issue with quantile
** Problem is probably worse if we ever decide to drop samples

Some notes:

- I need to correct for outliers in the model matrix. Could get potential aberrant normalized quantile distributions otherwise

DONE in the new normalization. 

Questions:

- JP, I usually tend to remove probes which measure a SNP or contain one (a total of 89,678 probes).  Should this be done pre-normalization or
	will the effect be minimal?


Answer: They should clearly be removed before



SOME ADDITIONAl NOTES:

- Need to write in the documentation for which scenarios FunNorm is preferable to QuantileNorm, and vice-versa.
- Need to discuss the predictSex() function in more details and how to use it in the FunNorm and QuantileNorm functions.

Some notes:

- I need to correct for outliers in the model matrix. Could get potential aberrant normalized quantile distributions otherwise

Questions:

- JP, I usually tend to remove probes which measure a SNP or contain one (a total of 89,678 probes).  Should this be done pre-normalization or
	will the effect be minimal?

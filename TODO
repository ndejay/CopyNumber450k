- No vignette included for Data package. We ask that a (short, e.g., one-page)
vignette be included for data packages so other users know the provenance of the
data and how to use it. Information such as how/from where you obtained the data
and what you did to use it with your code is useful.

Man page:

- No \examples for code package. We ask that runnable examples be provided for
all user-facing functionality in the package. This would be a good place to use
the "toy" data set mentioned above.

R files:

- More than 80 chars/line. This isn't strictly a problem, but many users
appreciate it when lines don't exceed 80 characters.
- In a couple places you have the number of chromosomes hard-coded as 22. It
seems like this isn't an issue for the platform you're using, but thought it
should be brought to your attention.

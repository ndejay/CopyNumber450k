- Consider only same sex individuals in formatSegments to infer distribution
- Uniformize the probe annotation (use the one from minfi)
- Fix the "gene" calling, stop using genes nearby probes and focus on genes overlapping genomic segments.
- Add band calls in formatSegments
- Remove hardcoded sexes, names and groups from object init.  Not having the columns named this exact way will cause object creation failure. No good!

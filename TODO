- Consider only same sex individuals in formatSegments to infer distribution
- Uniformize the probe annotation (use the one from minfi)
- Fix the "gene" calling, stop using genes nearby probes and focus on genes overlapping genomic segments.
- Add band calls in formatSegments


Nic:
- Consider merging formatSegments() into buildSegments(). Is it a good idea? Or maybe change formatSegments() to a CNVobject method. But this should be hidden from the user since this method is mendatory.
> YES, Agreed. Rename to SEGMENTIZE?

- Add sexes in formatSegments().  For chr X and Y, we have to compare to the distributions of same-sex individuals.

- Rename subgroupsDifferenceCNVByType.  Also, this method method should not be seen by user (internal).
- Consider internalizing normalization methods.  Everything should be CNVobject centric.
- Internalize extractFromRGset450k ??

- Currently, the plot() and plotRegion() take a path in parameter and generates pngs with hardcoded dims.  I don't like to force that, but those methods generate 1 plot per sample. How to do this user-friendly? Also, I want to avoid having 23234234 params in the function.

Question to YOU now:
> Do you remember if we had to document both generics AND methods back in the mRMRe project?
